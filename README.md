### Create a C program that calculates your weekly pay

The purpose of this program is to utilize if/else statements

1. The program asks the user to enter the number of hours worked in a week via the keyboard
2. It display the gross pay, the taxes and the net pay

#### These are the following assumptions:
- Basic pay rate: $12.00/hr
- Overtime (in excess of 40 hours): 1.5
- Tax rate:
  - 15% of the first $300
  - 20% of the next $150
  - 25% of the rest
